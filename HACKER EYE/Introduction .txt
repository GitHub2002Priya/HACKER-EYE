Introduction 

HackerEye is a valuable online website.
 It provides us the security for accessing URLs and files and make us know in file or URL malicious present or absent.
Users can upload files (up to 650 MB) or submit URLs for analysis.
The platform allows users to check for viruses that their own antivirus software might have missed or to verify against false positives.
It aggregates data from numerous antivirus products and online scan engines, collectively known as Contributors.
Dynamic Malware Analysis:
Website employs the Cuckoo sandbox for dynamic analysis of malware.
This process identifies malicious behavior and patterns in suspicious files.

How It Works:
 Antivirus Scanners: Hacker Eye inspects items using over 70 antivirus scanners and URL/domain blocklisting services.
 Signal Extraction: It employs various tools to extract signals from the content being studied.
User Interaction: Any user can select a file from their computer using their browser and send it to Hacker Eye .



PROPOSED METHODOLOGY

The Hacker Eye Website employs a straightforward methodology :-
 Our purpose will provide the safety and security both for the users before go through any of the URLs and images or if any data present in duplication form in social media will detect.

1. Data Collection and Labeling:
Positive Dataset: Collect a dataset of known malicious URLs. This can be obtained from threat intelligence feeds, security organizations, or publicly available datasets.
Negative Dataset: Gather a dataset of legitimate URLs to provide a baseline for comparison.
2. Feature Extraction:
Extract relevant features from URLs. Features can include the length of the URL, presence of specific keywords, use of subdomains, and other characteristics known to be associated with malicious URLs.
3. Machine Learning Model:
Train a machine learning model on the labeled dataset. Common algorithms include decision trees, random forests, or neural networks.
Evaluate and fine-tune the model for accuracy and precision.

4. Heuristics and Rules:
Implement heuristics and rules to identify common patterns or indicators of malicious URLs. This can include checking for known malicious domains, patterns in URL structure.
5. Behavioral Analysis:
Implement behavioral analysis techniques to detect anomalies. This might involve analyzing user behavior, traffic patterns, or identifying sudden spikes in activity.
6. API Integration:
Integrate with threat intelligence APIs to enhance the detection capabilities. These APIs can provide real-time information about known threats.
8. User Feedback and Reporting:
Implement a mechanism for users to report suspicious URLs.
Use user feedback to continuously improve the detection model.
9. Regular Updates:
Regularly update the system with new threat intelligence to stay current with emerging threats.10. Cross-Browser Compatibility:
Ensure that the malicious URL detection works across different web browsers and platforms.

11. User Education:
Provide educational resources to users about recognizing and avoiding malicious URLs.
12. SSL/TLS Analysis:
Analyze SSL/TLS certificates associated with URLs to detect potential phishing attempts.
13. Scalability and Performance:
Design the system to be scalable, ensuring it can handle a large number of requests efficiently.
14. Incident Response:
Implement an incident response plan to quickly address and mitigate any false negatives or emerging threats.
15. Legal and Ethical Considerations:
Ensure compliance with legal and ethical considerations regarding privacy and data protection.





PURPOSE

Hacker Eye serves as an internet security, file, and URL analyzer.
It aggregates data from numerous antivirus products and online scan engines, collectively known as Contributors.
Users can upload files (up to 650 MB) or submit URLs for analysis.
Website allows users to check for viruses that their own antivirus software might have missed or to verify against false positives.
Cuckoo sandbox is used for dynamic analysis of malware. It is an open-source tool used for automatically analyzing malware .
